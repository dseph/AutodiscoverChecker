About AutodiscoverChecker:

This sample is based upon an old Exchange SDK sample for Autodiscover.  It uses shows how to do different forms of autodiscover using raw code to find discovery information. It currently does not support oAuth.  The code is quite old and needs to be updted to work with o365.  It may need some fixes since it has not been maintained since 2016.
